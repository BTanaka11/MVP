## Image 2 Tile Puzzler ##
  An image split and rotation game and a cousin of jigsaw puzzles and tile puzzles.
  For players of all ages looking to kill some time on their train ride to work.

## Summary ##
This app is a puzzle game in which the player rotates tiles of a split up randomly generated image to try to restore the original image as fast as possible. Score is based on time and uploaded to a leaderboard. Tired of Sudoku? Give this a try! It solves the problem of commuter boredom too.
